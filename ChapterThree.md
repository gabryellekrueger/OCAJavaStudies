# Chapter three â€“ Core Java APIs

![Question 01](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question01.png)

- ## 1: Option G. The code does not compile because Java understands that int + int == int, and does not cast that to String. We need at least one String variable in the equation for Java to understand the '+' as concatenation and not addition.

![Question 02](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question02.png)

- ## 2: Options A, C and D. Option A and option C because the 'equals' is comparing the content of the String objects. Option D because "Hello" and 's' are in the same String pool, therefore being compared as the same object.

![Question 03](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question03.png)

- ## 3: Options B, C and E.

![Question 04](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question04.png)

- ## 4: Option B. The code compiles, and StringBuilder.insert() function takes the slot on the String as the first parameter, starting on 0.

![Question 05](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question05.png)

- ## 5: Option F, the code does not compile because you can't compare String to StringBuilder through '=='.

![Question 06](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question06.png)

- ## 6: Option B. We may call .concat() on a String, but if we don't capture the return, it does nothing, because a String is immutable. The StringBuilder, on the other hand, is muttable, and is changed through .append().

![Question 07](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question07.png)

- ## 7: Options B, D and E. The code compiles, but throws an OutOfBoundsException when going through the last line.

![Question 08](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question08.png)

- ## 8: Options A, D and E. Substring, when used with two parameters, gets the caracters at the positions 'parameter1' and right before 'parameter2'. But when it is used with only one parameter, it goes on from that position until the end of the String.

![Question 09](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question09.png)

- ## 9: Option C. Strings are immutable, so calling toUpperCase(), trim() or .substring(1, 3) on it will do nothing to the original String. But when we use '+=' with one or more Strings, Java understands that it must concat them.

![Question 10](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question10.png)

- ## 10: Option F. The code compiles just fine and the concatenations occur, but when we use '==' it compares objects, not content.

![Question 11](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question11.png)

- ## 11: Option E. An IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown because on line 8 the indexes are reversed.

![Question 12](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question12.png)

- ## 12: Option A.

![Question 13](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question13.png)

- ## 13: Option F. We can't assign Strings to StringBuilder. The correct way would be StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder("rumble").

![Question 14](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question14.png)

- ## 14: Options A and C. Option A is the easiest way, but we could append the reverse, delete the first three letters ("Jav") and then delete whatever isn't necessary.

![Question 15](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question15.png)

- ## 15: Option C, E and F. Option C is wrong because it uses the name of the variable as a type, and options E and F are wrong because they don't sepcify the size of the array.

![Question 16](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question16.png)

- ## 16: Option C. The property 'length' of arrays is used to retrieve the amount of slots it has.

![Question 17](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question17.png)

- ## 17: Option F. ArrayList, not like arrays, has a method 'length()' to retrieve the amount of slots it has.

![Question 18](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question18.png)

- ## 18: Options A, C, D, E.

![Question 19](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question19.png)

- ## 19: Options B and C. Two ArrayLists with the same content are equal because ArrayList compares content through it's equals() overriding. If you call remove(0) using an empty ArrayList object, it will compile successfully, but it won't run successfully, it will throw an indexOutOfBoundsException.

![Question 20](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question20.png)

- ## 20: Option D. The code won't compile because we defined that only String objects could be added to the list.

![Question 21](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question21.png)

- ## 21: Option C. First we add 4 to the list, then 5, then substitute 5 with 6, then remove 4, being left with 6.

![Question 22](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question22.png)

- ## 22: Option D. We cannot know the result because the array is not sorted.

![Question 23](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question23.png)

- ## 23: Option A. First we create an Integer List, populating it. Then we sort it and convert it back to an array, printing the first sorted position.

![Question 24](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question24.png)

- ## 24: Option C. To convert an array to a list, we use Arrays.asList(names). The 'names.asList()' does not exist.

![Question 25](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question25.png)

- ## 25: Option D. The sorting goes Number -> LETTER -> letter, so it sorts to s [30, 3A, 8, FF]. The binary seraches finds '8', '3A' but not '4F', returning then the index it should be, reversed and -1.

![Question 26](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question26.png)

- ## 26: Options A, B and D. Lines 5 and 7 use autoboxing, and when the 'for' tries to unbox 'null' into int, it throws a NullPointerException.

![Question 27](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question27.png)

- ## 27: Option B. The equals() compares content, so they are the same.

![Question 28](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question28.png)

- ## 28: Options D and F.

![Question 29](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question29.png)

- ## 29: Option D. We can't add hours to LocalDate, it only supports dates.

![Question 30](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question30.png)

- ## 30: Option F. We can't set '40' as a day because months have at most 31 days, so Java throws an exception.

![Question 31](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question31.png)

- ## 31: Option B. Since LocalDates are immutable, 'date.plusDays(2)' or 'date.plusYears(3)' does nothing to 'date'.

![Question 32](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question32.png)

- ## 32: Option E. When we use the formatter, it trims the dates and only keeps the time.

![Question 33](./pictures/ChapterThree/Question33.png)

- ## 33: Option B. Since 'Period' does not allow chaining methods, only the last one is applied.
